  <h1> Oh My Darling!

<br />

  <small>  Lyrics to one of my favorite songs </small>


  </h1>


<p class="content-paragraph">

<br />
  In a cavern, in a canyon, <br>
  Excavating for a mine<br>
  Dwelt a miner forty niner,<br>
  And his daughter Clementine<br>
<br>



  <text>
  <i>
  Chorus: <br />
  Oh my darling, oh my darling, <br />
  Oh my darling, Clementine! <br />
  Thou art lost and gone forever<br />
  Dreadful sorry, Clementine! <br />
</br>
</i>

</text>
  Light she was and like a fairy,<br>
  And her shoes were number nine,<br>
  Herring boxes, without topses,<br>
  Sandals were for Clementine. --Chorus  <br>
  <br>

  Drove she ducklings to the water<br>
  Ev'ry morning just at nine,<br>
  Hit her foot against a splinter,<br>
  Fell into the foaming brine. -- Chorus<br>
<br>
  Ruby lips above the water,<br>
  Blowing bubbles, soft and fine,<br>
  But, alas, I was no swimmer,<br>
  So I lost my Clementine. -- Chorus<br>
<br>
  How I missed her! How I missed her,<br>
  How I missed my Clementine,<br>
  But I kissed her little sister,<br>
  I forgot my Clementine. -- Chorus<br>
<br />
