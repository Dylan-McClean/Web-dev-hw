## Assignment 07


1. Here are the differences.


<ul>

<li>

 "divs" are the main seperators of the whole page into different sections of content.

</li>

<li>

 "Classes" are attributes within the divs to give each section of content a particular stylized look referenced from the css stylesheet as in background and text color along with many other characteristics like these.

 </li>

 <li>

 The "id's" are simply labels within the code itself to help web developers identify the type content that is being seperated by "div" tags.

 </li>

 <li>

"Span's" are elements that can also reference class attributes from the css stylesheet to alter the characterstics of any type of content within the pages.

 </li>


</ul>

  2. "Alt text" is used as a way to label content that either isn't loading right away or for people that aren't able to view that content as easily others.

3. My work summary is as follows. I setup the basic file structure for repository. Then I setup my text editor with everything ready to go for the assignment. I reviewed the whole weeks worth of learning material in the module website. I setup the basic structure of divs for the webpage. I became acquainted with referencing stylesheet attributes and elements. I inserted audio and video by following along with the walk through. I wrapped up the assignment by typing up the readme and then submitted the links for grading.
