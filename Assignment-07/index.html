  <h2> Jailhouse Rock Lyrics </h2>

<p>

  <p>
  The warden threw a party in the county jail
  The prison band was there and they began to wail
  The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
  You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

</p>

<p>


  Let's rock
  Everybody, let's rock
  Everybody in the whole cell block
  Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

</p>

<p>

  Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
  Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
  The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
  The whole rhythm section was a purple gang

</p>

<p>

  Let's rock
  Everybody, let's rock
  Everybody in the whole cell block
  Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

</p>

<p>

  Number 47 said to number 3
  "You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
  I sure would be delighted with your company
  Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"

</p>

<p>

  Let's rock
  Everybody, let's rock
  Everybody in the whole cell block
  Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

</p>

<p>

  Sad Sack was sittin' on a block of stone
  Way over in the corner weepin' all alone
  The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
  If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"

</p>

<p>

  Let's rock
  Everybody, let's rock
  Everybody in the whole cell block
  Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

</p>

<p>

  Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake
  No one's lookin', now's the chance to make a break"
  Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix
  I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks"

</p>

<p>

  Let's rock
  Everybody, let's rock
  Everybody in the whole cell block
  Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
  Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock, dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
  Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock, dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
  Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock, dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
  Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

</p>
