<li>

There is a total of two different main document elements a page can have. These are known as the <i> HEAD </i> and the <i> BODY </i> elements.

<p>

The <i> head </i> element establishes what the web browser will regard as the title of the website along with its author and date it was published.

</p>

<p>

The <i> body </i> element establishes that everything in between these tags will be displayed on the webpage. As in things like images, text, tables, etc. Which make up the actual content of the page as a whole.

</p>

</li>

<li>

The difference between structural and semantic markup is quite self explanatory.

<p>

 <b> Structural </b> markup is designated solely for the structure of the webpage. As in structure of how paragraphs, heading, and other elements can be displayed.

 </p>

<p>

<b> Semantic </b> markup is essentially the markup for the language within the page.
The various types of characteristics you can give words such as bold, italic, abbreviations, superscript, subscript, etc.

<li>

My work cycle for this week was mainly focusing on research for the various tags on semantic markups. Then applying and messing around with these to create a well thought out design for my recipe website.
