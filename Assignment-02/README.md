# Assignment 2
## Dylan McClean
<br>
I decided to take this class mainly because I needed to brush up on my coding skills for html and css. And I hope someday I can rely on these skills to make my own websites without the need for having to pay for web design services such as Wix or Squarespace.

### 1. I want to learn the basic codes for embedding images, video, and audio.

### 2. I am hoping to be able to custom build my own CSS templates.

### 3. I want to dive into more of the interactiviy aspect of web design and devolopment.
