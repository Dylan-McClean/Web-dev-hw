<hr>

My dad gave me one dollar bill<br>
‘Cause I’m his smartest son,<br>
And I swapped it for two shiny quarters<br>
‘Cause two is more than one!<br>



And then I took the quarters<br>
And traded them to Lou<br>
For three dimes — I guess he didn’t know<br>
That three is more than two!<br>


Just then, along came old blind Bates<br>
And just ’cause he can’t see<br>
He gave me four nickels for my three dimes,<br>
And four is more than three!<br>


And then I took the nickels to Hiram Coombs<br>
Down at the seed-feed store,<br>
And the fool gave me five pennies for them,<br>
And five is more than four!<br>


And then I went and showed my dad,<br>
And he got red in the cheeks<br>
And closed his eyes and shook his head <br>
Too proud of me to speak!
